# This YAML configuration file is used to set up and configure the Slides Search RAG template.
# It defines various components such as data sources, language models, embedders, indices, and data schema.
# Each section is configured to specify how the template should process and handle data for generating responses.
# You can learn more about the YAML syntax here: https://pathway.com/developers/templates/configure-yaml



# $sources defines the data sources used to read the data which will be indexed in the RAG.
# You can learn more how to configure data sources here:
# https://pathway.com/developers/templates/yaml-examples/data-sources-examples
