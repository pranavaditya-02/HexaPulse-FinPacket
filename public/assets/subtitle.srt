00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,320
Welcome to Yahoo Finance's flagship

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,840
show, The Morning Brief. I'm Julie

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,600
Hyman. Let's get to the three things you

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,520
need to know today. First up, US stock

5
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,440
futures rebounding this morning after

6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,360
the major averages sold off in Tuesday's

7
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,360
trade. Despite the modest pullback,

8
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,040
stocks are still trading near record

9
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,560
highs. The S&P 500 has now gone 107

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,039
sessions without a drop of at least 2%.

11
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,199
That's its longest stretch since July

12
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,160
2024. Tech stocks bore the brunt of

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,439
selling on Tuesday, but they are

14
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,199
rebounding amid some renewed AI

15
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,359
optimism. Some of that is coming from

16
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,280
Micron earnings. The memory chipmaker

17
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,440
gave an upbeat outlook driven by demand

18
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,760
for AI equipment. Shares of the company

19
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,760
have nearly doubled this year and the

20
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,079
latest results are further bolstering

21
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,399
investor optimism. We're seeing a little

22
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,640
bit of wavering in the shares after that

23
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,640
big run we've seen this year. And

24
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,039
Alibaba soaring to a 4-year high after

25
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,239
unveiling its AI plans. CEO Eddie Woo

26
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,920
said the company will ramp up AI

27
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,160
spending above an original target of $50

28
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,399
billion. The e-commerce giant made the

29
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,079
announcement at its annual technology

30
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,320
conference. It also revealed a software

31
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,550
partnership with, of course, Nvidia.

32
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:16,400
[Music]

33
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,159
Let's get a check in on stock futures

34
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,439
here this morning. So, all three major

35
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,840
averages pointing to a slightly higher

36
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,240
open here. We've got the Nasdaq leading

37
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,720
those early gains, indicating a rise of

38
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,880
about a quarter percent at the open with

39
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,439
the Dow and the S&P 500 participating as

40
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,600
well. Let's dig into our top stories of

41
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,360
the day. Futures are indeed higher as

42
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,439
stocks look to recover losses from that

43
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,079
prior session. Plus, JPAL keeping his

44
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,079
options open as he warns of the Federal

45
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,320
Reserve's quote challenging situation

46
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,880
and Alibaba soaring as it bets big on

47
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,479
AI. Joining me now, senior reporter

48
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,479
Brook Depal live at the NASDAQ, Federal

49
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,600
Reserve correspondent Jennifer

50
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,520
Sharonburgger and Morning Brief Market

51
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,240
Sunrise host Ramzan Carmali. Um, let's

52
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,600
start with you, Brooke. And looking at

53
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,079
this backdrop for stocks where yes, we

54
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,399
saw some wavering yesterday, but now

55
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,159
perhaps a resumption of that push to

56
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,479
highs,

57
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,080
Julie, we were on quite the hot streak

58
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,920
there. Record setting hot streak,

59
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,760
especially heading into Monday's close.

60
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,400
And after we did see that momentum, the

61
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,640
third straight day of record high closes

62
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,720
on Tuesday, we did see all three major

63
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,160
indices slide slowly uh slightly lower

64
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,000
uh than those record highs all closing

65
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,480
in the group uh the red rather on

66
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,480
Tuesday afternoon. And now you could see

67
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,760
here we are gaining some momentum this

68
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,480
morning largely led by Micron largely

69
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,360
led by this AI trade rally and some

70
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,879
renewed optimism that the Federal

71
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,160
Reserve will cut interest rates in this

72
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,160
year. We did hear from Fed chair Jerome

73
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,959
Pal on Tuesday and he did suggest that

74
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,760
equities were highly valued right now

75
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,440
and so investors really tried to digest

76
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,519
that. that led to a lower close on

77
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,720
Tuesday and now we're seeing some

78
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,480
renewed optimism to kick off this

79
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,920
Wednesday's trading session.

80
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,040
>> Yeah. And let's talk about some of the

81
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,120
sources of that optimism, guys. Um

82
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,360
Ramson, you know, there has been this

83
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,720
interesting sort of stutter start, if

84
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,640
you will, with AI sentiment, right?

85
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,920
Where people get very excited and then

86
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,040
they're like, "Wait a minute, is it

87
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,000
really that big of a deal?" And then

88
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,200
something new happens and they get

89
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,519
excited again. And this morning, Alibaba

90
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,599
seems to be the upward catalyst, or at

91
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,000
least one of them.

92
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,879
It c certainly is. So the the Chinese

93
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,640
tech giant, it's unveiled a sweeping AI

94
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,120
push and it'll be partnering with Nvidia

95
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,120
to build cuttingedge AI infrastructure

96
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,080
and rolling out its Quen 3 Max language

97
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,959
model. Now investors love the news. The

98
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,959
Hong Kong listed stock jumped close to

99
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,120
more than 9% high. In fact, at one point

100
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,120
during the day, it hit a 4year intraday

101
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,519
high as well. And keep in mind trading

102
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,200
volumes in Hong Kong were pretty low

103
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,760
because um much lower than usual anyway

104
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,440
because the city's bracing itself for

105
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,000
the impact of the super typhoon regassa

106
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,480
as well. So that's even more impressive.

107
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,680
And as you can see in the pre-market uh

108
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,000
ADR shares, they're up almost 9% in New

109
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,640
York as well. Now Alpha Alibaba CEO

110
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,200
Eddie Woo said that demand for AI has

111
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,519
blown past expectations and he's pledged

112
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,840
to invest $50 billion for global

113
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,720
expansion. But like other Chinese

114
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,799
companies, Alibaba does face a bit of a

115
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,040
dilemma over access to Nvidia's AI

116
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,280
processors, which they need to train

117
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,360
advanced models. Now, Beijing is pushing

118
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,680
the country's tech firms like Alibaba to

119
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,720
wean themselves off Nvidia's AI chips,

120
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,280
nearly all of which are blocked by US

121
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,440
export controls. It's also worth noting

122
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,520
that Alibaba's ADRs, which are listed in

123
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,040
New York, as I said, well, they're

124
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,720
trading back at levels from four years

125
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,880
ago, but they're still about half of

126
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,960
what they were 5 years ago.

127
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,120
And shares in China and Hong Kong though

128
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,199
definitely did get a boost overall in

129
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,120
this news. Both the Hangen and the

130
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,240
Shanghai Composite are up sharply today.

131
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,560
And in fact, Asian stocks are trading

132
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,720
near four-year highs and remain on track

133
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,160
this month for their best monthly

134
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,080
performance in a year. I mean, Julie,

135
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,440
who said that September was meant to be

136
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,880
a poor month for stocks?

137
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,720
>> Yeah. Well, there's a few days left.

138
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,280
Don't don't jinx it, guys. Uh Brooke,

139
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,759
let's talk about the other AI driven

140
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,199
story that we are watching this morning.

141
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,960
And that is Micron. The shares initially

142
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,720
were higher after it reported after the

143
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,560
close. They have been wavering a little

144
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,400
bit.

145
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,039
Yeah, we did get a pop in uh after

146
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,080
market close on W or Tuesday. And now

147
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,000
we're seeing that reverse just a bit to

148
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,520
the downside down about 5 cents a

149
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,120
percent after this runup that this

150
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,800
company has had year to date. But the

151
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,639
memory chipmaker, which is used

152
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,520
alongside those Nvidia A uh Nvidia chips

153
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,080
in these AI data centers, beat on both

154
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,680
the top and bottom line. And that did

155
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,680
drive some renewed optimism about what

156
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,240
exactly this momentum, this AI trade

157
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,479
rally could be. So Micron beat them both

158
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,080
the top and bottom line. Their fiscal

159
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,440
fourth quarter revenue came in, as you

160
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,479
can see on your screen, at 11.3 billion.

161
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,240
That was more than the street had

162
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,720
expected. Adjusted earnings also beat as

163
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,759
well, coming in at $3.3. Also higher

164
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,680
than what the street has expected. And

165
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,600
it was this this outlook, this guidance

166
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,759
for the first quarter that also got Wall

167
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,240
Street excited perhaps. The CEO saying

168
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,840
on the call that over the coming years

169
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,400
they expect to trillions of dollars to

170
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,199
be invested in AI and a significant

171
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,280
portion of that they say will be spent

172
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,240
on memory, their key business there. And

173
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,000
there was this hope, this optimism on

174
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,400
the street overnight. We did see six

175
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,120
firms raise their price targets this

176
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,720
morning in the early hours of this

177
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,479
morning. That includes Barclays. That

178
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,560
also includes Key Bank as well as Piper

179
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,400
Sandlers. You could see there most of

180
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,039
them gearing towards that $200 price

181
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,120
point. We also heard from Wedbush,

182
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,600
Needam, and Rosenblats. They also raise

183
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,919
their uh price targets as well. And I do

184
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,000
want to point out that Rosenlat now has

185
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,919
the highest price target on the street

186
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,199
of $250. And if you take a look at where

187
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,919
the stock stands now at $165, that would

188
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,880
be an $100 additional value. And so

189
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,520
really waiting to see this momentum that

190
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,360
continues behind this stock. As you can

191
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,479
see, it's had quite the rally,

192
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,240
especially over these key summer months.

193
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,479
>> Yeah, we're going to dig more into what

194
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,960
the company is doing in the next hour.

195
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,120
Um, and then we also have to talk about

196
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,360
um a speech or speeches, I guess, that

197
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,960
happened yesterday. We were talking a

198
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,759
lot about uh Jerome Pal and his speech,

199
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,360
but there were also some other Fed

200
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,520
officials that we need to talk about as

201
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,880
well, right, Jen?

202
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,960
>> Yeah, that's right, Julie. Uh, Fed Chair

203
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,520
J. Pal not offering too much new in his

204
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,240
speech on Tuesday. Very non-committal on

205
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,199
the policy front, reiterating that the

206
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,520
balance of risks have shifted and that's

207
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,160
why the Fed cut rates that rates are

208
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,400
still modestly restrictive and that the

209
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,039
Fed's not on a preset course. Pal

210
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,440
reiterated that given the challenges to

211
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,440
both sides of the dual mandate, both on

212
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,759
employment and inflation, there is no

213
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,960
risk-free path for policy. But perhaps

214
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,039
the more interesting remarks on Tuesday

215
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,520
came from Fed Governor Michelle Bowman,

216
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,520
who said she is more concerned about

217
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,680
weakness in the labor market and the

218
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,960
economy, less concerned about inflation,

219
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,520
and wants to take preemptive action to

220
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,919
support the job market. She said she's

221
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,240
gaining confidence that the impact of

222
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,160
tariffs on inflation are not going to

223
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,639
lead to longerlasting inflation. In

224
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,240
fact, she said she thinks lower

225
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,280
immigration could a actually push down

226
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,680
inflation. An argument we have heard

227
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,800
from new Fed Governor Stephen Myron. Uh

228
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,720
but she warned that the job market has

229
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,440
become fragile and could deteriorate

230
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,760
significantly. Those are her words in

231
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,599
the coming months. And I just want to

232
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,320
read a passage from her speech yesterday

233
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,880
where she said, quote, "In my view, the

234
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,120
recent data, including the estimated

235
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,920
payroll employment benchmark revisions,

236
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,480
show that we are at serious risk of

237
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,640
already being behind the curve and

238
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,560
addressing deteriorating labor market

239
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,480
conditions. Should these conditions

240
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,800
continue, I am concerned that we will

241
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,760
need to adjust policy at a faster pace

242
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,320
and to a larger degree going forward."

243
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,880
So all eyes on her and perhaps that next

244
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,839
jobs report due out on October 3rd.

245
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,399
Bowman also went as far as to say that

246
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,600
the Fed is too data point dependent and

247
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,399
that data is inherently backwardlooking

248
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,720
and can put the Fed behind the curve and

249
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,760
that the Fed should be more

250
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,600
forward-looking, an approach that she

251
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,360
plans to take and one that the

252
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,040
administration has also been pushing

253
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,320
for.

254
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,480
>> Guys, thanks so much. A lot to consider

255
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,000
here this morning. Brooke, Jennifer

256
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,640
Ramson. Appreciate it. Coming up on

257
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,760
Morning Brief, we'll bring you today's

258
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,279
top trending tickers as we count you

259
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,720
down to the opening bell. Don't go

260
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,080
anywhere.

261
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:44,619
[Music]

262
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,519
And now time for some today's trending

263
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,120
tickers. We are watching Lithium

264
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,680
America's Oracle and Acadia Pharma.

265
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,600
First up, Lithium Americas. Those shares

266
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,360
are surging following reports that the

267
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,440
Trump administration is pursuing a stake

268
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,360
in the company. The White House proposed

269
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,959
taking equity in the lithium producer

270
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,360
during a renegotiation of the terms of a

271
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,920
$2.3 billion loan extended by the energy

272
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,519
department. That's according to

273
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,600
Bloomberg. Those shares are surging by

274
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,519
66% and we're seeing a lift to some

275
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,560
other lithium miners as well. Next up,

276
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,240
Oracle. The company reportedly looking

277
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,720
to raise $15 billion from corporate bond

278
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,320
sales. According to Bloomberg, the

279
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,000
software maker is selling debt in as

280
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,079
many as seven parts, including a rare

281
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,160
40-year bond. The deal comes as Oracle

282
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,760
begins to fulfill massive cloud

283
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,600
infrastructure deals with OpenAI and

284
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,440
Meta, which are boosting the company's

285
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,200
expenses. In the next several years,

286
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,880
it's projected to spend hundreds of

287
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,959
billions of dollars to rent and power

288
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,920
data centers. And finally, Aadia Pharma.

289
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,680
Those shares are sinking after the drug

290
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,320
makers rare disease drug trial failed.

291
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,760
The latest stage trial of its

292
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,360
investigative therapy to help treat

293
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,399
hyperphasia did to did not meet its

294
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,560
primary endpoint. Stifel analysts say

295
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,160
the trial failure removes one of the

296
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,480
potential upside drivers for that stock

297
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,040
and those shares down 12%. Meanwhile,

298
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,720
shares of Seleno Therapeutics, which

299
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,240
currently markets a drug to treat

300
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,440
hyperphasia, did jump on the news. As

tickers page. Well, big AI names took

305
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,800
some losses during trade Wednesday with

306
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,959
Nvidia and Oracle recovering pre-market

307
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,200
after both closing lower. My next guest

308
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,720
says announcements of major deals

309
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,720
between those companies and OpenAI could

310
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,560
be fueling what he calls a potentially

311
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,720
epic bubble. Joining us now is Joe

312
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,240
Heganner, Astrazoa Capital CIO. Joe,

313
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,279
thanks for being here.

314
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,240
>> Thanks for having me.

315
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,640
>> So, it's been really interesting to

316
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,279
follow this AI trade. We've seen, as I

317
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,480
was talking about earlier in the show,

318
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,160
sort of the waxing and waning of

319
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,279
sentiment, right? This is going to be

320
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,360
the biggest thing ever. How could it

321
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,680
possibly be? Oh, all these companies are

322
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,040
spending money. they're spending too

323
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,720
much money with, you know, so it seems

324
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,120
like we're in another one of those

325
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,320
waning or at least questioning phases.

326
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,000
Is that fair to say? And and do you

327
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,240
think it's valid to question the whole

328
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,760
uh structure of the thing?

329
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,279
>> Well, I definitely think it's valid to

330
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,279
question uh the overall structure and

331
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,519
the phenomenon that's taking place. Um

332
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,880
you know, we're we're drawing a lot of

333
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,880
similarities between what's happening

334
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,880
now and of course.com. That's not

335
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,279
necessarily a new reference. Um, but the

336
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,839
thing I think is particularly

337
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,480
interesting, right, is just the timing

338
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,240
of of market bubbles and what what's

339
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,399
brings them to a halt, I suppose, right?

340
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,279
You the dot era, the only thing that

341
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,920
really popped or burst that bubble was

342
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,680
the Fed raising interest rates, right?

343
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,920
And and um kind of

344
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,160
>> that led to, you know, the epic crash.

345
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,800
But for years there were commentators

346
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,440
and professionals and analysts from 1995

347
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,519
all the way to 2000 that were pounding

348
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,200
the table saying we're in a bubble.

349
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,800
We're in a bubble. And they were right.

350
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,920
But if you got short in 1995, right? You

351
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,440
know, you weren't you didn't exist by

352
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,040
the 1999 and you missed out on 40% plus

353
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,120
equity market returns for for years to

354
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,720
come. And so that's the interesting

355
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,720
thing I think that's taking place now is

356
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,600
I definitely think we are in a bubble.

357
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,920
Uh and so you know what do you do at

358
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,000
this stage, right? Because we just cut

359
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,680
interest rates and we're looking at

360
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,920
cutting more and there's fiscal spending

361
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,800
coming down the pike,

362
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,560
>> right? So there's nothing externally

363
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,040
necessarily that would burst the bubble.

364
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,480
>> If anything, I feel like we're about to

365
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,880
pour some gasoline on the fire and um

366
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,720
and so that's what gives us a little bit

367
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,800
of pause because I definitely think the

368
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,440
the left tail scenario, the the risk to

369
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,160
the downside is immense because by any

370
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,000
measure valuations are very stretched.

371
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,680
We're seeing all sorts of these circular

372
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,800
deals that we saw in 1998, 1999 with

373
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,639
some of the same players as we're seeing

374
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,079
today. Um, and yet it's very difficult

375
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,480
for me to actually get bearish right now

376
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,360
because there are so many positive

377
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,079
catalysts as it relates to um kind of

378
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,160
pushing this sentiment towards more uh

379
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,120
extreme levels.

380
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,120
>> So, and you're on the credit side of the

381
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,079
equation, right?

382
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,240
>> Mostly mostly on the credit side. Yes.

383
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,560
>> So, how do you then play it? I mean, and

384
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,079
you mentioned some of the same players

385
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,120
like Oracle, which you know, experienced

386
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,880
the bust in the dotcom era, but they're

387
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,160
still around and they're back and

388
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,000
they're bigger than ever. Like, do you

389
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,839
go in I we just talked about their bond

390
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,920
sale. Do you go in and is that an

391
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,279
attractive offering?

392
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,120
>> Uh, well, I would argue absolutely not,

393
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,160
but um but it's just not necessarily

394
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,839
anything to do with Oracle. It's just a

395
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,160
function of credit spreads broadly right

396
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,160
now are the near the lowest they've ever

397
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,839
been in history. and and it does look

398
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,680
like we're seeing some macroeconomic

399
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,160
deterioration in you know jobs data and

400
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,240
things along those lines and you know a

401
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,560
$15 billion investment grade issuance at

402
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,800
sofur plus 40 basis points is just not

403
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,760
compelling to us

404
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,600
>> I I want to just translate that for

405
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,040
people who are not steeped in the in the

406
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,720
credit market. So basically, you are not

407
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,600
getting paid

408
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,079
>> exactly

409
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,560
>> as an investor to make these investments

410
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,920
right now is another way to put that.

411
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,519
>> You're getting paid Yes. Exactly. Right.

412
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,360
You're getting paid 40 extra basis

413
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,480
points per year in yield over treasuries

414
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,040
to assume the credit risk of of a

415
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,920
corporation that could not exist in 10

416
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,519
years from now. And it's very difficult

417
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,000
to say. I mean, if you had if you asked

418
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,240
me or any professional in 1995 if you

419
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,440
thought Blackberry was going to be

420
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,920
around in 10 years, I mean, most people

421
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,120
would probably say they'll for sure be

422
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,560
around. And there's just there's all

423
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,000
sorts of things that could happen over

424
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,680
the long haul. And so when you're

425
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,880
thinking about credit risk in

426
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,399
particular, you just want to be a little

427
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,399
bit more discerning. Um, and so the way

428
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,519
that we're kind of looking at that or

429
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:34,800
playing that is

430
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,360
>> we're actually playing mostly on a

431
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,440
relative value basis. And so, you know,

432
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,600
we can buy credit default swaps that

433
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,680
effectively would be you'd be short the

434
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,199
the the credits that you don't like.

435
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,120
>> So, you're basically buying insurance

436
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,440
against the company defaulting on its

437
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,160
debt at some point.

438
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,839
>> Exactly. The beautiful thing about that

439
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,839
instrument is that the lower credit

440
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,079
spreads go, the smaller your insurance

441
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,800
premium is for the protection. And so,

442
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,720
as they get lower and lower and more and

443
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,360
more compressed, it costs us less and

444
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,959
less to buy. It's that old saying,

445
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,399
right? Buy insurance when you don't

446
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,000
think you need it. And so how do you end

447
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,680
up making money on those then?

448
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,199
>> Well, it's a relative value. That's a

449
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,639
great question, right? So if you if you

450
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,440
give me $100 and I buy $100 worth of

451
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,600
bonds and the yield on that is eight or

452
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,600
nine%, I'm happy to take one or 2% perom

453
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,360
of that to purchase protection on the

454
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,800
credits that I don't like.

455
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,759
>> Gotcha. Okay. So um so that's how you're

456
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,600
looking at things right now. How do

457
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,000
yield how do does what the Fed is doing,

458
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,240
how does that feed into all of this?

459
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,639
>> Oh gosh. um you know

460
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:37,920
>> in 20 seconds. No, I'm just

461
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,199
>> Yeah. So, uh I think that there's Yeah,

462
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,399
I think there's an enormous amount of

463
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,959
risk over the intermediate to longer

464
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,120
term as it relates to the shape of the

465
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,079
yield curve. Um in terms of the polarity

466
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,839
that seems to exist within the Federal

467
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,040
Reserve right now. There are a handful

468
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,639
of people, and I'm kind of in this camp,

469
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,040
too. I think it's very hard to argue

470
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,279
that financial conditions are tight when

471
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,120
crypto is going parabolic and equity

472
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,760
markets are all-time highs and there's

473
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,919
um what did Powell say in his presser

474
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,520
the other day? It was effectively

475
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,959
Greenspan's version of a rational

476
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,959
exuberant stock valuations are elevated.

477
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,799
I think he said

478
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:19,280
>> um the jobs data while deteriorating

479
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,839
it's unclear to me how much of that is a

480
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,520
function of efficiency and productivity

481
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,480
gains. Right? If I'm a law firm and I

482
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,319
don't need the 100 analysts anymore

483
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,720
because I have AI embedded tools and I

484
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,600
don't hire as much, I'm immensely more

485
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,440
productive and my equity value is

486
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,640
actually going to be significantly

487
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,240
higher, but the jobs data is going to be

488
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:38,960
weaker,

489
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,280
>> right? And so these there are structural

490
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,799
structural changes that are taking place

491
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,919
in the economy that could lead to weak

492
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,480
economic data or weak jobs data, but it

493
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,400
doesn't necessarily imply that changing

494
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,320
the interest rate at the Federal Reserve

495
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,919
overnight rate is going to do anything

496
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,520
to adjust that or fix that. If anything,

497
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,720
you're just going to pour gasoline on

498
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,200
that fire.

499
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,640
>> So you think there's a risk to them

500
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,679
continuing to cut rates?

501
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,520
>> Yes, definitely. And I think we'll see

502
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,440
that. And if if if that is correct,

503
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,960
we'll we'll continue to see the yield

504
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,799
curve steepen, the long end of the curve

505
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,240
start to go higher and higher as the

506
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,760
front end comes down.

507
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,559
>> And that also to your earlier point

508
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,160
makes the maybe extends the bubble even

509
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:16,960
further.

510
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,600
>> Yes, I I do. And I do also think if the

511
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,280
long end of the curve continues to march

512
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,240
higher, we'll see some sort of uh yield

513
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,520
curve control via Bessant or or maybe

514
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,600
even the Federal Reserve who you know

515
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,120
Trump's going to install the new Fed

516
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,200
chair in not too long of a time from

517
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,919
now. Um and he's already had significant

518
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,559
influence on you know who's who the

519
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,760
board of governors are, right?

520
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,840
>> And so it could be a very different

521
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,760
Federal Reserve in a year from now than

522
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,720
the one we're seeing today.

523
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,240
>> And just briefly, yield curve control.

524
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,000
How what would that look like? Well,

525
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,360
there's a number of ways to play that

526
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,280
out, but effectively, right, but there's

527
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,080
um you would a government or a central

528
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,799
bank would implement that if they don't

529
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,080
like long end the the trajectory of long

530
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,360
end interest rates, right? The Fed can

531
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,120
only control the overnight rate and then

532
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,480
the rest of the curve is extrapolated

533
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,320
out via markets.

534
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,080
>> But you can take a bazooka and go buy

535
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,840
hundreds of billions of dollars worth of

536
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,640
30-year Treasury bonds and force the

537
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,520
30-year rate lower. Um you could also

538
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,520
and this is OB they've already mentioned

539
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,000
this publicly you could uh deregulate

540
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,440
the banks to where you could encourage

541
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,919
or facilitate uh you know the large

542
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,640
banks in the US to uh purchase be

543
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,280
purchasers of uh long end treasury bonds

544
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,360
to increase demand to lower interest

545
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,120
rates. There's a number of tweaks and

546
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,960
and if anybody's going to do it Scott

547
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,360
Besset is the guy. um you know he

548
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,160
understands capital markets so well that

549
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,799
um if you know if he wants lower rates

550
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,480
I'm not necessarily going to bet against

551
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,160
him because he's got a lot of levers at

552
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,200
his disposal.

553
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,960
>> Okay, got to leave it there. Joe, thank

554
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,960
you so much. Interesting. All right,

555
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,799
coming up on Yahoo Finance Opening Bid,

556
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,320
our executive editor Brian Sazi is

557
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,520
joining us now to give us a little

558
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,799
preview. What's coming up?

559
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,400
>> Uh Julie, uh really interesting chat

560
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,919
there. I thoroughly enjoyed all the chat

561
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,240
on credit. But as for opening bid, I am

562
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,240
staying on the AI trade. I think this

563
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,039
notion that uh we are near peak AI capex

564
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,640
needs to be completely tossed in the

565
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,840
trash. Look at that good news out of

566
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,160
Micron Alibaba overnight. Good stuff

567
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,360
indeed, Julie.

568
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,200
>> Looking forward to it. Thanks, S. That

569
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,400
does it for morning brief. Much more

570
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,280
ahead on Yahoo Finance.
